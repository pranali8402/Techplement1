Deploying application in Monolithic Architecture using Single EC2 Instance

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to deploying WordPress with MySQL on a single EC2 instance (Monolithic Architecture).
1.Launch an EC2 Instance
  Instance Type: t2.micro
  AMI: Ununtu
  Security Group Configuration
    ->SSh(22)
    ->HTTP(80)
    ->HTTPS(443)
    ->MySQL(3306)
2.Connect to the EC2 Instance
Once the instance is running, connect via SSH:
  ->ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@ec2-public-ip
3.Install Required Packages 
  ->sudo apt update
  ->sudo apt upgrade
  ->sudo apt install apache2
  ->sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
  ->sudo apt install mysql-server
Enable and start Apache:
  ->sudo systemctl enable apache2
  ->sudo systemctl start apache2
4. Configure MySQL
Create a WordPress database and user:
  ->sudo mysql -u root
  ->ALTER USER 'wpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Password@123';
  ->CREATE USER 'wpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password@123';
  ->CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
  ->GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wpuser'@'localhost';
  ->exit;
5.Install and Configure Wordpress
Download and Extract WordPress:
  ->cd /tmp
  ->sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
  ->sudo tar -xvzf latest.tar.gz
  ->sudo mv wordpress/ /var/www/html
  ->sudo systemctl restart apache2
6. Access WordPress
Open a browser and go to:
  ->http://<instance_public_ip> in your browser.
  ->Complete the Wordpress installation process.
  ->Log in to Wordpress Admin (http://<instance_public_ip>/wp-admin).
  ->If we want to create a page go to Pages->Add new.
  ->Create a page called "Welcome".
  ->Go to Settings->Reading->Set Welcome page as the homepage.
  ->Save the changes.
It creates welcome page in wordpress that will be the homepage.
